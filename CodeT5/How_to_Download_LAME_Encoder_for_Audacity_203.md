Audacity is a free and open source audio editor that can record, edit, and export various audio formats. One of the most popular formats is MP3, which is widely supported by many devices and platforms. However, Audacity does not include a built-in MP3 encoder due to licensing issues. Therefore, you need to download and install a separate encoder called LAME to enable MP3 export in Audacity.
